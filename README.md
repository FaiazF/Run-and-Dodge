# Run and Dodge 🏃‍♂️💨

A simple **endless runner game** built using **[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)** in C++. The player controls *Scarfy*, who must dodge obstacles while running toward the finish line. Background layers scroll to create a parallax effect, and the game features collision detection, jumping mechanics, and win/lose conditions.
